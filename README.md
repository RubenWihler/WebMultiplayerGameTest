## Introduction
This is a test of a multiplayer game using websockets and a node.js server.
I am using typescript for the client and server.
For the client I am using HTML and CSS for the UI and canvas for the game.
For the server I am using express and socket.io.

## How to build
I have made a [build script](tools/build.sh) for the client and server. Just run `./tools/build.sh` to build the project.
